== Installation
* The Roby engine needs 
  * +utilrb+, which is available either as a gem or on {my research
    page}[http://www.laas.fr/~sjoyeux/research.php]
  * +utilmm+, available on {my research page}[http://www.laas.fr/~sjoyeux/research.php]
  * Facets, available on RubyForge[http://facets.rubyforge.org] or as a gem
  * ActiveSupport, available on RubyForge[http://facets.rubyforge.org] or as a gem

* Once the source is installed, additional setup must be done by using 
    rake setup
  +utilmm+ must be available to pkg-config (make sure that the +<prefix>/lib/pkgconfig+,
  with <prefix> the directory in which +utilmm+ has been installed is in +PKG_CONFIG_PATH+)

  Note that if Rake is not available on your system, you can install it by using RubyGems
    gem install rake

* the Genom plugin need Genom.rb, which in turn needs +typelib+ and +utilmm+. 
  All three are available on {my research page}[http://www.laas.fr/~sjoyeux/research.php]

== Creating a new Roby application
Along with Roby is installed the +roby+ executable, which can create the skeleton of a
new Roby application. C
