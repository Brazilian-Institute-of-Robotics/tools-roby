=== 0.7.3

* fix needed update to run on latest activesupport
This is probably the last release of 0.7. The 'next' branch will become 0.8 as
soon as it is tested enough

=== 0.7.2

* fixed a memory leak regarding the event propagation histories. Until now,
  all the propagation histories where kept through Event#sources, leading to
  actually keeping most plan objects since the beginning of execution. This
  is fixed by internally using weak references. Histories will therefore be
  truncated as the Ruby GC removes references to the concerned plan objects.
* misc small fixes, which mostly remove some false negatives in the test suite
* small change to be compatible with 1.8.7

=== 0.7.1

* Fixed extension handling in 'rake setup'. It should work again.
* Fixed a lack of proper synchronization in operations without an execution
  thread. This led to pile of strange errors in Roby's own test suite, but
  should not have impacted normal operations (where a separate execution thread
  exists)
* Fixed a potential race condition in PlanningTask

=== 0.7

* First public release. This release is still not compatible with Ruby 1.9, as
  too many bugs remain in 1.9.0
