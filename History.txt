=== 0.7.1

* Fixed extension handling in 'rake setup'. It should work again.
* Fixed a lack of proper synchronization in operations without an execution
  thread. This led to pile of strange errors in Roby's own test suite, but
  should not have impacted normal operations (where a separate execution thread
  exists)
* Fixed a potential race condition in PlanningTask

=== 0.7

* First public release. This release is still not compatible with Ruby 1.9, as
  too many bugs remain in 1.9.0
