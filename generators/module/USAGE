Generates a new empty module within the models/ hierarchy. The name must include
the toplevel namespace in the model hierarchy as such:

  roby gen module compositions/a/helpers
  roby gen module Compositions::A::Helpers

If a robot name is specified with the -r option, the files will be created in
this robot's specific folders

Example: running the following command in a rock_auv app
  roby gen compositions/control/net_gen

  will generate a RockAUV::Compositions::Control::NetGen module in
  models/compositions/control/net_gen.rb as well as the associated test file in
  test/compositions/control/net_gen.rb. The files in the hierarchy
  (models/compositions.rb, models/compositions/control.rb,
  test/compositions/suite_control.rb, ...) are updated to require the new
  file(s)
