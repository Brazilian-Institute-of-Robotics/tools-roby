    # The namespace in which Roby's default schedulers are defined

    # In Roby, the scheduler is an object that decides which tasks to start at
    # any given time. There can be only one scheduler, which is set at
    # initialization time with
    #
    #   Roby.engine.scheduler = <scheduler object>.
    #
    # For instance
    #
    #   Roby.engine.scheduler = Roby::Schedulers::Basic.new
    #
    # Then, the scheduler's #initial_events method is called at the
    # beginning of each execution cycle. This method is supposed to call
    # whatever event is reasonable to call with respect to the system's
    # state (i.e. execution situation).

        #    may be non-root in the dependency relation, in which case it is
        #    started if and only if it has at least one parent that is running
        #    (i.e. children are started after their parents).
