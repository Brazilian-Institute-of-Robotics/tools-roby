  * is compatible only with Ruby 1.9
  * Task#event only takes :command and the block to define a controllable
    event. Don't search for a method with the same name anymore.
  * for 1.9, a block defined as { } is a block with arity zero. Therefore,
    all blocks given to Task#event, Task.event and the various #on methods
    must have an argument defined.

The 'clean up this mess' release
  * major clean. Among them: transaction semantics, of ownership handling
    and of garbage collection
  * be compatible with 1.8.6's thread library: Queue#get is no more
  * major improvement in relation display. It is actually useful now ;-)
  * More robust distributed Roby: most of the calls that are supposed to
    be done outside of the control thread are now synchronous. This avoids
    a lot of issues. Major cleanup of the subscription/update mechanism
    which is a lot more streamlined now.
