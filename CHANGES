The 'clean up this mess' release
  * major clean. Among them: transaction semantics, of ownership handling
    and of garbage collection
  * be compatible with 1.8.6's thread library: Queue#get is no more
  * major improvement in relation display. It is actually useful now ;-)
  * More robust distributed Roby: most of the calls that are supposed to
    be done outside of the control thread are now synchronous. This avoids
    a lot of issues. Major cleanup of the subscription/update mechanism
    which is a lot more streamlined now.
